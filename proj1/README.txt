Describe any help or outside resources used (or write "None"):
Meetings with LT Gentile to discuss design and go over failed test cases.

Which interface did you implement using linked lists, and why?
I used linked lists for my Text implementation because it provides the fast insertion and deletion.

Which interface did you implement using arrays, and why?
I used a circular array for my Stack implementation because it would be easier to limit the size of the stack with an array rather than a linked list.

What part or aspect of this project was the most challenging?
Trying to debug edgecases that were breaking a lot of my implementations.

What part or aspect of this project was the most tedious or
uninteresting?
Adding redo functionality.

How did the difficulty and time required for this project
compare to those in your other CS/IT courses?
It took more time, but that's because it was a project. 

Any other comments for your instructor?
