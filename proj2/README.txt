Estimate how well you did on each part, on a scale of
0 (nothing) to 5 (perfectly correct and efficient):
  Part 1 (TreeMap):    4 / 5
  Part 2 (Pharmacies): 4 / 5
  Part 3 (TopK):       5 / 5
  Part 4 (Zips):       4 / 5
  Code style:          5 / 5
  Bonus (faster):      ? / 5

Please explain your self-assessment scores above:
I feel like my tree can be optimized to be more efficient. Which code relying on my tree would also be more efficient.

What did you do to thoroughly test your own code?
I wrote test files and junit after coming up with as many edge cases and normal cases as I could think of.

What part or aspect of this project was the most challenging?
Trying to optimize my code to make it more efficient.

Explain what you did for the bonus (if anything):


What part or aspect of this project was the most tedious or
uninteresting?
Generating correct output to test my implementation against.

How did the difficulty and time required for this project
compare to those in your other CS courses?
It took a little bit longer time than most other projects.

Any other comments for your instructor?
I think more work on the 2-3-4 trees would have been helpful.
